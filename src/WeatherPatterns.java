        // rest

        // Maybe keep a duplicate map that stores whether or not a location has already been visited to limit the number of paths that
        // can be produced from that location or keep a score and the number of potential things after it at that point that are bigger.

        // there was a 57 later on with a 58 after it as well, then you could skip.

        // Highest string below it that's below the actual number and then add +1

        // if there were the number 1 4 7 20 9, you would go that the max is 3 for 7
        // so when you reach 20, the answer would be 4, but when you reach 9, it would also
