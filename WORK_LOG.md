| Jan 13  | 2:30-3:00pm  | For the last 30 minutes of class after we were introduced the new problemset, I began thinking of ideas and talking with some of my classmates about how to tackle this problem. Though I never used it, my original idea for this project was to iterate through every single one of the temperatures, place them into a 2D map where the index was the temperature and the values stored at each location were the index of said temperatures, and then to go from the smallest one in each category and find the longest run by iterating through the entirety of the temperature list again for every single value. Wasn't a very good idea in retrospect but it was at least a start. |
| Jan 15  | 12:35-1:23pm |                                                                  Created a new algorithm that basically starts at a specific location in the temperature array, and then looks forward by an increasing number of spaces to then add the longest current run with the end temperature in the window into a map. Using this information, I was able to check the new longest run for each additional temperature that was being checked by finding the longest previous run with a lower temperature and adding 1 to that value. Makes it so the overall runtime is somewhere close to n squared time instead of n cubed. Passes 4/5 of the test cases but is still slow for the final one. |

Was able to do this by reducing the overall number of checks I did by finding small time saves like not checling temperatures that can't possible generate a new longest run etc. |
